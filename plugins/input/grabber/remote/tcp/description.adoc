Description::
Gets its screen data from a remote grabber over network.
The plugin acts as a TCP client and tries to connect to the remote screen grabber using `address` and `port`config parameters.
After establishing a connection the plugin will send the `client_name` parameter to identify itself.
The plugin also sends the parameters `width` and `height` to tell the server the resolution of the target image.
This can reduce the size of transfered data over the network.
