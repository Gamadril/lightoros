===== Remote Named Pipe Grabber
Kind:: `RemoteScreenPipeGrabberInput`
Config::
[source]
--
{
    path: string,
}

Description::
Gets its screen data from a remote grabber on the same host using a named pipe.
The plugin acts as a pipe reader using the `path` config parameter.
Because a named pipe is unidirectional the plugin is only getting data and not sending any information to the grabber.
This plugin is useful when embedding the lightoros engine in an android app.
