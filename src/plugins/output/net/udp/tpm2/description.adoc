    ip: string,

Description::
Sends the RGB data over UDP socket using the TPM2 protocol.
System dependent there might be a restriction for the size of a single UDP packet.
`max_packet_length` is used to define the max possible size of a single UDP packet.
The plugin will split RGB data if necessary to several UDP packets and use TPM.net protocol.
However there is no guarantee for the order of the UDP packets, especially not in a network with a router.
