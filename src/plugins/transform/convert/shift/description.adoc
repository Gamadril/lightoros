    amount: integer
}

Description::
Handles the input data as ring buffer. All elements are shifted to the right (clockwise) by the number of positions specified by the `amount` parameter.
If the value of `amount` is negative, elements will be shifted to the left (anti-clockwise).
This plugin is mainly used to rotate elements in the data buffer to fit the start position of the LED stripe in an ambilight installation.
